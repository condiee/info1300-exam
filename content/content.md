## How to Buy Our Products
You can find us at the Ithaca's Farmers Market during the warmer months of the year where we sell our eggs and in the spring baby chicks. During the off-season, our stand at the coop is open on Saturdays and Sundays from 12 pm to 3 pm. Our eggs are always fresh and of the highest quality!

## Volunteer Positions Available
Volunteer at the farm and learn how to raise your own chickens. You'll gain experience, managing a flock, raising chicks, and collecting eggs. We're a welcoming community and would love to have you join us in the coop a few times a week. Send us an email at _info@kylescrazycoop.com_ or call us at 607-CHICKEN to learn more.

Welcome to Kyle's Crazy Coop!

We take pride in the fact that we are one of Ithaca's newest chicken farms; we've been here since 2015! We not only sell all the eggs and and _live_ chickens you could want, but we also like to foster a community.

We pride ourselves in our ethical chicken rearing. You'll find ample space in the back of the barn to sit down and chat for a few hours and get to know our chickens.

We hope to see you in the coop soon!

## How We Raise Our Chickens
We strive to give our chickens the best care possible. We provide the best quality, hormone-free, chicken food to all of our chickens. We keep our coops nice and clean, and we keep our nesting boxes optimal for egg production while providing plenty of walking space for our chickens. If you're curious about our setup, come to the coop to see it for yourself! We're just a short bus ride away.

## About Us
Founded in 2015, we were one of the newest farms in the city of Ithaca. Ever since then we've been proudly serving the community. We took part in the Ithaca Chicken Fest in 2017 which allowed us to expand our coop and distribute our products to more people in the area. It was so exciting to meet chicken and farm enthusiasts from all around the state and even the world. We've also participated in the New York State Fair in 2018. Now, we're focused on building our connections with the community. The Todds have been running the shop ever since 2016, including most recently our current owner Kyle Todd.
